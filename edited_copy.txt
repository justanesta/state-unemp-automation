edited_copy.txt – AP Style editorial pass on assignment draft paragraphs
=========================================================================

Each paragraph below shows the original draft, the edited version, and notes
on what was changed and where the upstream fix belongs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARAGRAPH A (Template Output)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"In TX unemployment was 3.9% for 2025-12 which is up 0.2 from last month.
The state now ranks among the highest unemployment rates nationally."

EDITED:
"Texas's unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in Dec. 2025, up 0.2 percentage
points from the prior month. Texas had the [N]th highest unemployment rate
in the country overall."

CHANGES & FLAGS:
- "In TX" → "Texas's unemployment rate was" — STATE NAMES must be spelled
  out. The template already resolves codes to canonical names; this was a
  template bug (bare code in output).  [FIX: template]

- "3.9%" → "3.9 percent" — AP Style: spell out "percent" in prose.
  [FIX: template]

- "for 2025-12" → "in Dec. 2025" — Dates must use AP Style month
  abbreviation. ISO format should never appear in user-facing copy.
  [FIX: template]

- "which is up 0.2 from last month" → "up 0.2 percentage points from the
  prior month" — Missing unit. "0.2" alone is ambiguous; must say
  "percentage points" when describing change. "last month" → "the prior
  month" for consistency.  [FIX: template]

- "The state now ranks among the highest unemployment rates nationally" —
  FLAG: unsupported ranking claim. "Among the highest" is vague and
  unverifiable without computed data. REPLACE with the actual computed
  national rank from the pipeline.  [FIX: methodology — template must
  render the computed rank, not a qualitative assessment]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARAGRAPH B (Template Output)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"California's unemployment rate decreased by -0.1 percentage points to
4.8%, showing improvement compared to last month. Data is accurate as of
Dec 2025."

EDITED:
"California's unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in Dec. 2025, down 0.1
percentage points from the prior month."

CHANGES & FLAGS:
- "decreased by -0.1" → "down 0.1" — DOUBLE NEGATIVE. "Decreased" already
  implies direction; the value must be the absolute change (0.1), not -0.1.
  The template should always pair the direction word with the absolute
  value.  [FIX: template]

- "4.8%" → "4.8 percent" — AP Style.  [FIX: template]

- "showing improvement compared to last month" — FLAG: editorializing.
  "Improvement" implies a value judgment. The template should state the
  direction and magnitude neutrally and let readers interpret.  Remove.
  [FIX: template]

- "Data is accurate as of Dec 2025" — FLAG: vague sourcing claim.
  "Accurate as of" does not specify the source or when it was published.
  Source attribution (e.g. "Source: BLS, [date]") belongs in a
  standardized footer on the page, not inline in the sentence.  Remove
  from template; add to page-level source note.  [FIX: methodology]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARAGRAPH C (Mixed Copy)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"Unemployment remained the same in New York at 4.3% (it was also 4.3%).
Nevada saw the biggest change of all states, while several others changed
slightly."

EDITED:
"New York's unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in Dec. 2025, unchanged from
the prior month. Nevada had the 1st largest month-over-month change in the
country overall."

CHANGES & FLAGS:
- "(it was also 4.3%)" — Redundant parenthetical. The "unchanged" template
  variant already conveys that the rate did not move. Remove.
  [FIX: template]

- "4.3%" → "4.3 percent" — AP Style.  [FIX: template]

- "Nevada saw the biggest change of all states" — FLAG: unsupported
  superlative. In the actual Dec 2025 data, this claim must be verified
  against computed MoM rankings before publishing. The template renders
  the computed rank (e.g. "1st largest month-over-month change in the
  country overall"), which is self-verifying.  [FIX: methodology]

- "while several others changed slightly" — FLAG: vague, unsubstantiated.
  "Several others" and "slightly" add no information and cannot be
  verified. Remove entirely. Each state's change is reported in its own
  entry; a cross-state summary like this belongs in a hand-written lede,
  not in template output.  [FIX: template — do not generate cross-state
  comparative prose from templates]

TABLE NOTES — EDITOR COMMENTS ADDRESSED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: "Should we say percent or percentage points here?"
A: These are distinct concepts and must never be conflated.
   - "percent" = the rate itself. "California's rate was 4.8 percent."
   - "percentage points" = the unit of change between two rates.
     "Up 0.2 percentage points." (Not "up 0.2 percent" — that would mean
     a 0.2% relative increase, which is a different number entirely.)
   The template enforces this distinction: rate uses "percent", change
   uses "percentage points".

Q: "This sounds like a ranking claim — is that supported?"
A: Ranking claims are supported only when generated from computed data.
   The pipeline computes competition rankings at national, regional, and
   divisional scopes. Any ranking sentence in the output is backed by the
   sorted data. Qualitative rankings like "among the highest" (Paragraph
   A) are never generated by the template — they must be removed if they
   appear.

Q: "Do we need an 'as of' or source note?"
A: Yes. Every published roundup should include a source footer:
   "Source: [source field from data], data as of [latest month]."
   This belongs at the page level (below the article or data table), not
   inline in individual sentences. The pipeline includes the `source`
   field in the wordsmith payload for the page template to render.
