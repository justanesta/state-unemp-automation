1. Home price data by CBSA. CBSA is the best unit of measure for cross-comparison that is somewhat analagous to "city". There are a number of sources that publish these: The [Federal Housing Finance Agency Quarterly Purchase-ONly House Price Index](https://www.fhfa.gov/data/hpi/datasets?tab=quarterly-data), the [S&P Cotality Case-Schiller Home Price Indices](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-cotality-case-shiller/sp-cotality-case-shiller-composite/#overview) for the top 20 MSAs. The Zillow sales count, price, total transaction data value, sale-to-list ratio, and percent of sales below/above list by MSA from their [housing data portal](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). realtor.com has a [similar collection of housing data measures](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/) as does [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/).
2. FreddieMac's Primary Mortgage Markey Survey for the [weekly average home mortgage rates](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms). Ideally there would be state or CBSA-level data for this but I am unsure if that exists publicly since the discontinuation of the FHFA's [Monthly Interest Rate Survey](https://www.fhfa.gov/data/mirs).
3. The Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.html) and [American Housing Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html) have data on property taxes, costs of common utilities, costs of repairs and maintenence, etc. by CBSA published annually.

I lean more towards open-source publicly-available data for these types of projects just because I find them typically more methodologically transparent and thus authoritative. I also helped create an analysis for [buying](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/the-average-cost-of-buying-a-home-in-the-us-5323803) and owning a home that incorporated these data for The Balance
