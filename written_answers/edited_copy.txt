Paragraph A (Template Output)
“In TX unemployment was 3.9% for 2025-12 which is up 0.2 from last month. The state now ranks among the highest unemployment rates nationally.”

1. Don't use the USPS state abbreviation TX. Use the full name Texas instead. This can be programmatically inserted.
2. Don't use YYYY-MM to display the date, use Dec. '25 or some other more human-readable format. This can be programmatically formatted.
3. Instead of "up 0.2" say "increased by 0.2 percentage points" to be more precise and descriptive of what the measure is and how it changed.
4. "[R]anks among the highest unemployment rates nationally" --> What rank is it exactly? This is able to be derived programmatically along with it's difference from the overall rate of the country as a whole, it's division/region, etc.

Paragraph B (Template Output)
“California’s unemployment rate decreased by -0.1 percentage points to 4.8%, showing improvement compared to last month. Data is accurate as of Dec 2025.”

1. This is a personal thing, but semantically having a rate decrease by a negative number can be a bit misleading, I would say "decreased by 0.1 percentage point"
2. "showing improvement compared to last month": What is the improvement? What are the months in question. These can be programmatically inserted.
3. "Data is accurate as of Dec. 2025": Typically this info is great for footnotes of charts or at the end of pieces. These can be programmatically inserted.

Paragraph C (Mixed Copy)
“Unemployment remained the same in New York at 4.3% (it was also 4.3%). Nevada saw the biggest change of all states, while several others changed slightly.”

1. "Unemployment" should be "The unemployment rate" to be precise.
2. "(it was also 4.3%)": This is repetitive and unnecessary.
3. "Nevada saw the biggest change of all states". What was the change? Change over what time period?
4. "While several others changed slightly". Several is how many? What is slightly? This can be programmatically put in.
